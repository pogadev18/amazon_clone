## Introduction

Here are  some key features of this project:
* it's a full react project on the front-end
* react context API for the global state (basket, user, flashMessage component)
* for the database I've used Firebase / Firestore
* full auth with firebase
* full payment integration with STRIPE's API
* mobile responsive

## A flow that you can play with on the live site
* add items to basket (the bakset will updated instantly)
* remove items for basket (the bakset will updated instantly)
* create account / sign in
* proceed to checkout
* when it asks for card details, just type "4242" until everything it's filled out
* see your order details
